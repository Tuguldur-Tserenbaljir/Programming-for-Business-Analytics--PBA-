#The boxplot reveals that the median voter turnout for Black voters is marginally higher when one or more Black candidates are present, as shown by the median line in the "Yes" #category compared to the "No" category. While the overall range of voter turnout is similar in both scenarios, there is slightly greater variability when Black candidates are #involved, particularly at the upper end of turnout. Additionally, the presence of outliers in the "No" category, where voter turnout is exceptionally high even without Black #candidates, suggests that factors other than the presence of co-ethnic candidates also play a significant role in influencing voter turnout.
